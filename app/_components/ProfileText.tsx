        Hi, Iâ€™m Stephan, a software developer with a background in 3D motion
        design. My journey started in the creative industry, working on visual
        storytelling and interactive media. But my fascination with
        problem-solving and technology led me into software development, where
        Node.js.

      <p className="mb-4">
        In 2025, I joined adesso as a software developer, where I get to work on
        exciting projects that blend creativity with technical expertise. I
        enjoy crafting clean, user-friendly applications and constantly
        expanding my skill set.

        When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me riding my gravel bike,
        playing guitar, or diving into the latest tech trends. ðŸš€
