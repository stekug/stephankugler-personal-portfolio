    "description": "The Wild Oasis Website is a Next.js application developed to explore and deepen my knowledge of modern web technologies. This project showcases advanced features of Next.js, such as static site generation, incremental static regeneration (ISR), and custom caching strategies. I integrated Supabase for authentication, authorization, and secure data management, including image uploads and user login systems. The website's design is crafted with Tailwind CSS and enhanced with Heroicons. Key functionalities include dynamic routing, client and server components, and context management using createContext and useContext. This project demonstrates my ability to build scalable and secure web applications with a focus on both performance and user experience.",

    "description": "The project created an immersive 3D animation experience for EFTA’s presence at Dubai Airshow 2023. Detailed 3D models of the airport and its surroundings were crafted in Cinema 4D and then imported into Unreal Engine to build a dynamic virtual world. Visitors could explore the virtual airport interactively, gaining insights into the academy’s programs, facilities, and advanced simulators. Due to the need to run the experience on a laptop, traditional baked lighting was used instead of LUMEN, which required careful UV unwrapping to produce high-quality lightmaps. Additionally, an animated image film was produced in Unreal Engine, tracing the journey of a cadet group from the start of their training to the successful completion of the program.",
