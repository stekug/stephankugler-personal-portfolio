This project showcases advanced features of Next.js, such as static site generation, incremental static regeneration (ISR), and custom caching strategies. I integrated Supabase for authentication, authorization, and secure data management, including image uploads and user login systems. The website's design is crafted with Tailwind CSS and enhanced with Heroicons. Key functionalities include dynamic routing, client and server components, and context management using createContext and useContext. This project demonstrates my ability to build scalable and secure web applications with a focus on both performance and user experience.",
